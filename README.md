# UnityUNLV_RollABall
UnityUNLV Game Developers creating our own Roll-a-Ball type game.

If this is your first time here, clone the repository (or download and extract the .zip) to the root of your Unity Projects folder (or anywhere else you would like to keep track of it.). This will create a new version of the game which we will be henceforth known as the 'master'. All features we add will be made to 'branches', which will then be 'merged' with once the features are tested and integrated.
